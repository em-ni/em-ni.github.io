To facilitate your decision process I think a short personal summary could be useful.

I would start with my bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering, which is the last non-intentional decision I took. 
I started it mostly guided by high school teachers and parents because "it would have secured me a job in the future." 
If I could go back, I would do something closer to math or physics. 
The bachelor indeed gave me basic knowledge of fundamental subjects such as math and physics, hence my regret.

My favorite subject was Rational Mechanics, which introduced me to dynamical systems and Lyapunov's theory of stability. 
For this reason, I decided to pursue a master's in Control & Robotics Engineering. 
Here, I had better academic results, probably driven by a higher interest in the subject (6th highest in the ranking as of 5 Feb 21).
Every year at uni I won an award based on academic results (GPA and ECTS):
- Borsecoll 2019, 20, 21
- Exam Bonus 2018 (rank 17/260),
- School-leaving examination 2017 (diploma grade ≥ 95/100).
My master's thesis is still my biggest work and the one I worked on with more passion and interest. It was about MPC control of soft robots. 
The thesis ended with the publication of a new MATLAB toolbox, which has been downloaded ~75 times more than I expected (the 2 downloads from my friends)!

In 2022 I worked as an external consultant for Fincantieri s.p.a., helping develop a self-balancing radar for a military ship. 
After some months, I also started working full-time for Medlogix s.r.l., implementing autonomous robotics systems in hyperthermia treatment.

Driven by a higher interest for research in robotics, in 2023 I started a PhD at UNSW. 
The idea was to apply part of the results of my master's thesis to automate surgical tasks, 
in addition to using computer vision and machine learning to localize the robot, detect objects and learn to navigate inside the human body.

However, I don't think that robotics and control are the central topics in the lab I am working in; 
therefore, I am looking for something closer to my interests, and the Robotic Systems Lab lab looks exactly like it.
Clearly, in addition to being one of the best labs in the world regarding robotics.

Recently, I developed a strong passion for making mobile apps. 
Most of them are "meme apps" just for fun, but for bureaucratic reasons, I had to gather them under a company, together with a friend of mine.

Finally, I really like learning new things.
One of my favourite topics is life in general: What is life? Why do we live? Why do we do what we do? I find these questions extremely interesting. 
Putting it in robotics and control terms, I want to find what is at the top of the hierarchy of the objective functions that we try to optimise for. 
It looks like entropy plays a role here, and some think that living beings are the part of the universe capable of reversing the second law of thermodynamics. 
I think that if we design robots such that they try to optimise for the same goals as us, in the long run, it would be very hard to make a distinction between a robot and a living being. 
I am also trying to organise all this information in a book I am writing, with the goal of understanding why we do what we do, so yeah, not only trying to understand the reason why I am applying for this position, but also the reason why you want a new PhD student.

To conclude, here is a list of projects I have worked on about robotics, control and machine learning, with the final grade, related publications or company in brackets.
