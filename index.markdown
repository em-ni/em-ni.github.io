Ciao! I am a PhD candidate in Surgical Robotics at UNSW, Sydney. 

Some things I like:<br> • Robotics, Soft Robotics<br>  • Control Theory, Model Predictive Control<br>  • Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning <br>  • Their application to surgical robotics

<!-- Some things I do: research, coding (mostly to move robots and for developing mobile apps), reading (mostly about engineering and a lot about philosophy), writing, playing football and calisthenics. -->



<!-- Before reaching Australia I was living in Rome, Italy, the city where I was born. 
Here I worked as a Robotics Software Engineer at Medlogix to implement autonomous robotics systems in the hyperthermia treatment for fighting cancer with technology. 

I have a Master's degree in Control & Robotics Engineering and a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering both from Sapienza University of Rome. -->

### Currently Working On
For my PhD, I am trying to automate surgical procedures using robotic systems. <br/>
For example, a soft robot could be capable of both navigating the bronchial tree and detecting suspicious lesions, only using the information from the camera. <br/>

-  Are the camera images and the exctracted features enough to know precisely where the robot is in the bronchial tree? <br/>
**Keywords**: SLAM, Visual Odometry, etc.<br/>

- Can we get close to 100% accuracy in detecting cancerous lesions using only computer vision techniques? <br/>
**Keywords**: Computer Vision, Deep Learning, etc.

- How to precisely control the robot to reach the desired location? <br/>
**Keywords**: Model Predictive Control, Reinforcement Learning, etc.
